## Problem 1

### Creating data frame 1

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

    ## ── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.2.1 ──

    ## ✔ ggplot2 3.0.0     ✔ purrr   0.2.5
    ## ✔ tibble  1.4.2     ✔ dplyr   0.7.6
    ## ✔ tidyr   0.8.1     ✔ stringr 1.3.1
    ## ✔ readr   1.1.1     ✔ forcats 0.3.0

    ## ── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──
    ## ✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
    ## ✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()

``` r
set.seed(758)

example_df1 = tibble(
  random_sample = runif(10, min = 1, max = 5),
  vec_logical = random_sample  > 2,
  vec_char = c("Liberia", "Tanzania", "Bangladesh", "India", "Ghana", "Indonesia","Nigeria", "Togo", "China", "Thailand"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("Africa", "Africa", "Asia", "Asia", "Africa", "Asia", "Africa", "Africa", "Asia", "Asia"))
)
```

### Mean of each variable in data frame

``` r
mean(example_df1$random_sample)
```

    ## [1] 3.64801

``` r
mean(example_df1$vec_logical)
```

    ## [1] 0.9

``` r
mean(example_df1$vec_char)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(example_df1$vec_char): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(example_df1$vec_factor)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(example_df1$vec_factor): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

*The mean of the random sample is 3.64801, whiles for the logical vector
is 0.9*

*The mean of the character varaibles and factor variables could not be
computed because they are not numeric or logical. Thus, do not have
assigned numeric values, which is needed in computation of a mean. A
mean can ony be computated from numbers*

### Conversion of variables from one form to the other (1)

``` r
as.numeric(example_df1$vec_logical)

as.numeric(example_df1$vec_char)
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

``` r
as.numeric(example_df1$vec_factor)
```

*The logical variables was converted to a numeric where TRUE was
assigned a numberic value of 1 and FALSE was assigned a numeric value of
0*

*The character variables were all converted to NAs, which was introduced
by coercion*

*The factor variables were all converted to 1s and 2s. 1 was assigned to
Africa and 2 was assigned to Asia*

### Conversion of variables from one form to the other (2)

``` r
character_factor = as.factor(example_df1$vec_char)
character_factor
```

    ##  [1] Liberia    Tanzania   Bangladesh India      Ghana      Indonesia 
    ##  [7] Nigeria    Togo       China      Thailand  
    ## 10 Levels: Bangladesh China Ghana India Indonesia Liberia ... Togo

``` r
as.numeric(character_factor)
```

    ##  [1]  6  8  1  4  3  5  7 10  2  9

``` r
factor_character = as.character(example_df1$vec_factor)
factor_character
```

    ##  [1] "Africa" "Africa" "Asia"   "Asia"   "Africa" "Asia"   "Africa"
    ##  [8] "Africa" "Asia"   "Asia"

``` r
as.numeric(factor_character)
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

    ##  [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

*The character variables were eventually converted to numeric variables,
by assigning numbers 1 to 10 in the order of how the
variables(countries) were arranged in the data frame. This conversion
was successful because characters were first converted to factors, which
can be converted to numeric variables*

*The factor variables could not be converted to numeric variables.
Instead, they were forced by coercison into NAs. This is because, the
factor variables were coverted into character variables, which cannot be
converted into numeric variables*

## Problem 2

### Creating data frame 2

``` r
set.seed(433)

example_df2 = tibble(
  x = rnorm(1000),
  y = rnorm(1000),
  vec_logical = x + y > 0,
  num_vec = as.numeric(vec_logical),
  fac_vec = as.vector(vec_logical),  
)
```

### Description of vector using inline Rcode

The size of the dataset is 1000 and the mean of x is 0.0351278. The
median of x is 0.0456441 and the proportion of cases for which the
logical vector is TRUE is
0.513

### Making of scatterplots

``` r
scatterplot_1=ggplot(example_df2, aes(x = x, y = y, color=vec_logical)) + geom_point()

scatterplot_1
```

![](p8105_hw1_ykk2116_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)<!-- -->

*The colour scales for the first plot (logical variables) is in a binary
form becaus the logical variables are binary format (TRUE or
FALSE)*

``` r
scatterplot_2=ggplot(example_df2, aes(x = x, y = y, color=num_vec )) + geom_point()

scatterplot_2
```

![](p8105_hw1_ykk2116_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)<!-- -->

*The colour scale for the second plot (numeric variables) are shaded or
categorized in 5 different levels of intensity, from 1 to 0, with 1
being the lighest intensity and 0 being the darkest
intensity*

``` r
scatterplot_2=ggplot(example_df2, aes(x = x, y = y, color=fac_vec )) + geom_point()

scatterplot_2
```

![](p8105_hw1_ykk2116_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)<!-- -->

*The colour scales for the third plot (factor variables) is in a binary
form because the factor variables are in a binary format (TRUE or
FALSE)*

``` r
ggsave("first_scatter_plot.pdf", plot=scatterplot_1, height = 4, width = 6)
```
